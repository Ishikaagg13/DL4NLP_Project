The painter of the present manuscript shows a clear understanding of the contents and the situations envisaged. One sees this on the very first folio which contains an invocatory verse in honor of Shiva. With great imagination the poet casts the deity in the role of a lover, considering that the theme of the whole work was essentially love. Everything points to Shiva trying to save his beloved, his left female half which is Parvati, any unnecessary effort. The painting is rich and colourful, with strong elements of stylization, as seen in his treatment of the rocks and the flowering plant.",
