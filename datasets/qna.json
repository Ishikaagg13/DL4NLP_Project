        "Answer4": "A toy but indexing life's actual mode, as it was then lived, this plaything, cast in fine clay, assembled using clay wheels and trolley for containing goods, and wooden shafts, is a tiny model of the carts that the Harappan settlers used in their day-today life for transporting their loads, and sometimes also passengers. The toy cart consists of two wheels with hubs, a trolley shaped like a bowl with a rectangular frame and two projections on its underside to attach it to the axel, a wooden shaft, draw-shaft, etc. The wheels and the trolley's projections are holed for the axle to pass through."

Armless, except the little parts adjacent to shoulders remaining, the woman's figure has been cast as standing straight with her legs positioned parallel and almost joined. Strangely, she has a muzzle-like elongated animal face, the style of nose in particular. There is a round cavity on the back between joints of hips, below the abdomen. Eyes and nostrils are marked by incision. "

Maybe, the pole is a post-restoration replacement of the tree-branch. The position of arms, legs, tail and neck is very realistically portrayed. The hair on the body, face and spinal column are shown by incised lines. The figurine has a hole between the joined hands and legs to allow him to move up and down along the pole. The end of the tail of the figurine is turned down."

        "Answer4": "One of the rarest artifacts in the world, the statue of a young lady now unanimously called 'Indus dancing girl', represents a stylistically poised female figure performing a dance. The forward thrust of the left leg and backwards tilted right, the gesture of the hands, demeanor of the face and uplifted head, all speak of absorption in dance, perhaps one of those early styles that combined drama with dance, and dialogue with body-gestures. The statue, recovered in excavation from 'HR area' of Mohenjo-Daro. The adornment of her left arm is widely different from the right. The left is covered in entirety with heavy ringed bangles. Besides, the figure has been cast as wearing on her breasts a necklace with four 'phalis' like shaped pendants. Though a small work of art, it is impressive and surpasses in plasticity and sensuousness the heavily ornate terracotta figurines."

Most likely it was used as a ritual vessel, an 'Offering Stand' or 'Censer'. It consists of two parts, the tray, or the dish, and the highly artistic stand. As is apparent, both parts have been independently molded on and joined together afterwards using still finer clay. The artifact has been coated with burnished slip ranging in colour from pink to deep red. Though largely washed, the vessel was once decorated all over with beautiful black paintings."

        "Answer4": "This large size figurine from Mohenjo-Daro is an excellent example of the technical maturity that Harappan artisans had acquired in clay modeling and baking. The coating of thick red slip seems to have been applied not to just add luster or finish but perhaps also for protecting its surface from erosion. The fan-shaped headdress is like a large pannier cup, which hung on either side can be seen here. The figure is adorned with two necklaces; smaller one has a set of four cylindrical pendants, while the longer one hangs between the breasts. The eyes have been conceived with two round pellets of clay, and the nose as pinched."

This seal with buffalo-horned figure almost unanimously identified as Shiva in his form as Pashupati, portrays him as seated cross-legged, in Yogic 'padmasana', and wide-armed.
